<!--
An AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML) call allows you to send and 
receive data from a server asynchronously without reloading the web page.

const xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();

// Open a GET request
xhr.open('GET', 'https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts', true);

xhr.onreadystatechange = ()=>{
    console.log(xhr.readyState);
}

// Define the callback function to handle the response
xhr.onload = function () {
  if (xhr.status === 200) {
    // Parse JSON data
    const data = JSON.parse(xhr.responseText);
    console.log(data);
  } else {
    console.error(`Error: ${xhr.status}`);
  }
};
// Handle network errors
xhr.onerror = function () {
  console.error('Request failed');
};

//open is called only when send is invoked.
// Send the request
xhr.send();



How It Works
AJAX Request:

The browser sends a request to the server using JavaScript (e.g., with XMLHttpRequest, fetch, or libraries like Axios).
The request is asynchronous, meaning the main thread (responsible for rendering the webpage) is not blocked.
Receive Response:

Once the server processes the request, it sends back a response. This response can be:
Raw text
HTML
JSON (commonly used in modern web apps)
XML (less common today)
Update DOM Dynamically:

After the response is received,
 JavaScript modifies specific parts of the DOM (Document Object Model) to reflect the new data. 
 This is done using methods like:
document.querySelector()
element.innerHTML
element.textContent
element.appendChild()
element.setAttribute()
No Full Page Reload:

Only the targeted parts of the webpage are updated. 
The browser does not reload the page or request all resources (CSS, JavaScript, etc.) again.


Why It Works
The onload handler is registered before the request is sent using send().
 This ensures that when the server responds, the browser knows which callback to invoke to handle the response.

The server will only send a response after it receives the request, so there’s no way the client receives the response before calling send().

0	UNSENT	Client has been created. open() not called yet.
1	OPENED	open() has been called.
2	HEADERS_RECEIVED	send() has been called, and headers and status are available.
3	LOADING	Downloading; responseText holds partial data.
4	DONE	The operation is complete.
